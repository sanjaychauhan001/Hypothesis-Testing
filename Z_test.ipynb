    "## Assumptions for a Z-Test:\n",
    "1. Random Sampling: The data should be collected through a random sampling process to ensure that it is representative of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normality: The population from which the sample is drawn should be approximately normally distributed. If the sample size is sufficiently large (typically n >= 30), this assumption can be relaxed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Known Population Standard Deviation: You should know the population standard deviation (σ). If you don't know σ and have a small sample size, you should use a t-test instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to perform Z-TEST\n",
    "#### 1. Formulate Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): This is the hypothesis of no effect or no difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (Ha or H1): This is the hypothesis that you want to test, which proposes a specific effect or difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Select Significance Level (α):\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a significance level (α), typically set at 0.05 (5%). This represents the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Calculate the Test Statistic (Z-Score):\n",

    "Sample Mean (x̄): The mean of your sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population Mean (μ): The value specified in the null hypothesis (often a known population mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "Population Standard Deviation (σ): Known population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Size (n): The size of your sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Determine the Critical Value(s):\n",
    "\n",
    "For a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level, the critical z-value is approximately ±1.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a one-tailed test (either left-tailed or right-tailed) at a 5% significance level, the critical z-value is approximately -1.645 (left-tailed) or +1.645 (right-tailed).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Compare the Test Statistic and Critical Value(s):\n",
    "\n",
    "For a two-tailed test, compare the absolute value of your calculated z-score to the critical values. If |z| > critical value(s), reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, fail to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a one-tailed test, compare your calculated z-score to the critical value for the specified tail. If z < critical value (left-tailed) or z > critical value (right-tailed), reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, fail to reject it."
